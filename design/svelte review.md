# pros
- like any other language that comes after the more popular languages, it seems they kept in mind a lot of things people run into and have features to handle them accordingly. it seems to take some of the best features of angular and react and puts them together
    - props are easy to define and control, and the system revolves around props similar to react
    - html directives are very simple, not a bunch to learn like in angular
    - 2way bindings are certainly convenient for people not used to how react works. and it seems they are trying to make it seem like it is for certain use cases only, and to use props otherwise. this makes it more like react with 2way binding than angular, which uses 2way binding in more cases

# cons
- still a bit rough around the edges with the available tools
    - svelte-check is not integrated into webpack, pretty scuffed to have it run seperately
    - svelte-check sometimes bugs out and catches weird errors
- at the current moment, it seems to be a re-imagining of react pretty much, but doesn't really offer more useful features.  usually the way this works is i get into something, cool and great that it feels new and different, but the thing that makes me stay is some feature that nothing else has, so i have to stick around to keep using that feature.
