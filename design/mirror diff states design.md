- arrows showing the direction of change
    - maybe not? not really enough space??
- redesign highlighting modified error problem, doesnt really stand out enough, just looks like another date on the list which is already rainbow, so its just another part of the rainbow. if every thing was one colour and it was different it would work, but not as it stands with the rainbow
    - perhaps have a thick background highlight? would be the only one with it
    - or underline
